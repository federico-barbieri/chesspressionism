                <h1 class="cancel-h1">CAN YOU CANCEL <br>A DICTIONARY?</h1>
                
                <p class="cancel-p">
                    Cancel culture is everywhere. 
                    In case you cannot find it, think of something controversial and post it. 
                    Yup, there it is. <br><br>

                    So what if a group of people questioned 
                    the way the dictionary defined an action? Could they.. cancel it? 
                    Is that even possible? <br><br>

                    You might be wondering where does all of this come from. 
                    And for that, I’ll be quite straightforward. <br><br>

                    The dictionary has been around for some time now. 
                    It knows its business. What works and what doesn’t. 
                    Heck, it even has the monopoly of what is what. 
                    Don’t believe me? Try defining what a sheep is. 
                    You’re thinking “a sentient being that makes weird noises and has wool”, 
                    aren’t you? What about a pug with a coat? See, it’s not that easy. 
                    And they know it. <br><br>

                    The dictionary has made quite a statement when declaring what chess is.
                    If you try to find an answer, it'll probably spin around the fact that
                    it has two players, there's a board and for someone to win they have 
                    to basically deprive their opponent's king from any kind of move. <br><br>

                    Now don’t get me wrong. I respect the realm where all these similar
                    definitions live, but I do think it falls a bit short. 
                    And maybe that’s what a definition is all about. But then again, who are 
                    you gonna ask that? The dictionary? <br><br>

                    If we were to use a “filter for controversy”, I guess we could agree that the 
                    fact that it involves two players, that it’s played on a board, and that 
                    it involves specific rules is kinda okay. <br><br>

                    But what about everything related to "the main objective" of the game? 
                    You'll find definitions that orbit around a one and only 
                    "this is what chess is all about". And yes, it's all about winning. <br><br>

                    What about improving yourself? Or maybe spending time with someone?
                    How's there space for only one objective? There’re thousands of them! <br><br>

                    Playing to win is just an excuse to reach so many new horizons. 
                    To experience how you react to specific situations. To try something new. 
                    To play mind games. To bet. To learn about risk management. To embody sacrifice. 
                    You get the point. <br><br>

                    In that sense, the dictionary’s spectrum of what chess is does fall short. 
                    It might have been fitting for the past 1500 years, but we need more. 
                    Way more.
