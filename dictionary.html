                <h1 class="cancel-h1">CAN YOU CANCEL A DICTIONARY?</h1>
                
                <p class="cancel-p">
                    Cancel culture is everywhere. 
                    In case you cannot find it, think of something controversial and post it. 
                    Yup, there it is.

                    Dictionary.com defines it as: 

                    ..the popular practice of withdrawing support for (canceling) public figures 
                    and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable 
                    or offensive. 

                    Which brings us to our question: what if a group of people questioned 
                    the way the dictionary defined an action? Could they.. cancel it? 
                    Is that even possible?

                    You might be wondering where does all of this come from. 
                    And for that, I’ll be quite straightforward. 

                    The dictionary has been around for some time now. 
                    It knows its business. What works and what doesn’t. 
                    Heck, it even has the monopoly of what is what. 
                    Don’t believe me? Try defining what a sheep is. 
                    You’re thinking “a sentient being that makes weird noises and has wool”, 
                    aren’t you? What about a pug with a coat? See, it’s not that easy. 
                    And they know it.

                    The dictionary has made quite a statement when declaring what chess is.

                    a board game of strategic skill for two players, played on a chequered 
                    board on which each playing piece is moved according to precise rules. 
                    The object is to put the opponent's king under a direct attack from which 
                    escape is impossible.

                    Now don’t get me wrong. I respect this definition, but I do think it falls 
                    a bit short. And maybe that’s what a definition is. But then again, who are 
                    you gonna ask that? The dictionary?

                    If we were to use a “controversial filter”, I guess we could agree that the 
                    fact that it involves two players, that it’s played on a chequered board - 
                    notice how they talk about pattern rather than color, which would have of course 
                    put them in the spotlight -, and that it involves specific rules is kinda okay.

                    But what about the last part? 
                    “The object is to put the opponent’s king under a direct attack from which escape 
                    is impossible”


                    What about improving yourself? What about spending time with someone?
                    There’s space for only one object? How? There’re thousands of them! 

                    Playing to win is just an excuse to reach so many new horizons. 
                    To experience how you react to specific situations. To try something new. 
                    To play mind games. To bet. To learn about risk management. To embody sacrifice. 
                    You get the point.

                    In that sense, the dictionary’s definition of chess -and may I say many other things-, 
                    does fall short. It might have been fitting for the past 1500 years, but we need more. 
                    Way more.
