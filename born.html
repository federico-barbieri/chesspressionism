                <p class="born-p">
                    Chess as we know it today, was born around the second half of the 15th century. <br><br>
                    That means Leonardo Da Vinci was alive and America had yet not been discovered. 
                    Crazy, right?<br><br>

                    To understand what kind of world weâ€™re talking about, 
                    here are a few things that happened during that time:<br><br>

                </p>

                <ul class="born-ul">
                    <li>Joan of Arc sentenced to death (1431)</li>
                    <li>Invention of the printing press (1440)</li>
                    <li>Construction of Macchu Picchu (1450)</li>
                    <li>Fall of Constantinople (1453)</li>
                    </ul>

                  <p class="born-p">  
                    It's almost absurd to consider the fact the game hasn't really changed
                    since then. What does that tell us about it? <br><br>

                    Well, basically, its perfection. How many games can withstand the test of time?
                    How many require an update every now and then for them to remain alive?
                    Chess, my friends, is an immortal beauty. <br><br>
