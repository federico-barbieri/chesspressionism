                <p class="shannon-p">
                    Given the fact that a chess board has 64 squares, 
                    and 32 are already occupied by pieces, you might be seduced 
                    to thinking there’s not too many moves one can make. <br><br>

                    But what if I told you there’re actually more potential 
                    moves in a chess game than atoms in the universe? <br><br>

                    This mind-blowing number is called The Shannon Number, 
                    and it was named after the american mathematician Claude Shannon. <br><br>

                    The number takes into consideration both legal and illegal moves, 
                    but even if you remove the illegal ones you still get a staggering 
                    amount of moves.<br><br>

                    What’s most interesting about this number is how it radically 
                    affects your perception about chess. It looks like a rather 
                    static game, but if you dig deep enough, you’ll realize creativity 
                    can take you as far as your imagination can go. <br><br>

                    I wonder how many other realms, industries and categories are restricted
                    only by our own bias, when in reality they're full of dormant opportunities,
                    waiting for us to unchain ourselves and try them all.<br><br>

                    Who knows.
