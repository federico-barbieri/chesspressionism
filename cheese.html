                    Depending on where you live, there’re different ways to smile for a picture. <br><br> 
                    In Bulgaria you say “Zele!”, which means cabbage. In Morocco you say “Khbiz!, 
                    which is bread. And in Sweden you say “Omelett”, which of course stands for omelette. 
                    There’s a whole kitchen out there. <br><br>

                    But there’s one ingredient which always takes the main stage. 
                    It’s as easy to say as delicious to consume. Yes, you got it. Cheese!<br><br>

                    Cheese has been there forever, or at least that’s how it feels every time 
                    someone’s trying to take a picture. But it’s come to our attention that there’s 
                    a new contender out there. It’s neither food nor beverage. It’s chess.<br><br>

                    The #ChessNotCheese movement is getting lots of traction, especially in northern 
                    europe. Rumors say it all started in Copenhagen, while two friends were playing 
                    a friendly game by the lakes. They wanted a selfie to remember that marvelous 
                    moment but instead of saying cheese, they said chess.<br><br>
